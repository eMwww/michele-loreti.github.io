I am Associate Professor in Computer Science at University of Camerino within the School of Science and Technology (Computer Science division). 

I have been Research Associate at University of Firenze from 2002 till 2017. From 2012 to 2016 I have been Visiting Professor at _IMT Institute for Advanced Studies_ within the SYSMA Group. 

I graduated in Computer Science at University of Rome "La Sapienza" in 1997 and received the PhD in _Mathematical Logic and Theoretical Computer Science_ at University of Siena in 2001 with the thesis _Languages and Logics for Network Aware Programming_.


My research is concerned with the study of formal tools for specifying and verifying qualitative and quantitative properties of concurrent and distributed systems with an emphasis on large scaled Cyber Physical Systems. I am author of more than 100 publications in international journals or books with international editors, and I have been "program chair" and member of program committees of many international conferences. Currently, I am in the the editorial board of the  Elsevier Journal on Logical and Algebraic Methods in Programming published (as assistant editor) and of the ACM Transactions on Modelling and Computer Simulation (as part of the Reproducibility Board).
